# Smart Oven Subsystem

A modular, real-time temperature control system for ovens, featuring sensor feedback, PID control, safety logic, and a web dashboard. Includes both hardware and dummy simulation modes for development and testing.

## Features
- Real-time temperature sensing and control
- PID tuning and simulation
- Safety shutoff for overheat and sensor errors
- Web dashboard for monitoring and control
- Data logging to CSV
- Dummy mode for hardware-free testing
